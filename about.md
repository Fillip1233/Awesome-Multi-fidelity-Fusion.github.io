# About this page.

Awesome FidelityFusion including the projects and work done by our team in the field of FidelityFusion

By leveraging the multi-fidelity data, the surrogate model can be trained with many low-fidelity data, which is cheap to generate, and a few high-fidelity data to predict the output of the high-fidelity simulation accurately.

FidelityFusion focus on tractable multi-fidelity fusion methods, which can be easily optimized and scaled to high-dimensional output with strong generalization and robustness.
